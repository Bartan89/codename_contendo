### FOR TAs
-- Summary of project:
+ IMPORTANT: TELL DIMITRI THAT SIMPLE FORM AND FORM HELPERS ARE SHIT. THANK YOU
+ After Effects (video editing software) can export all text in the video as a
  JSON file
+ Project aim is to be a library of videos where users can import JSON files and
  easily edit them through forms and then other users can download the translated
  JSONs
+ WARNING: First translation uploaded for a video (a video has many translations,
  a translation has many lines) is the main transcript and the base for all
  other translations.
+ WARNING: Every time you create a new translation that is not the transcript,
  the controller will clone the original translation (aka the transcript, aka
  @video.translations.first) and its lines and redirect to an EDIT view for that
  newly cloned model.
+ Yes I know that's not necessarily the most performant, but fuck form helpers
  by the way.
+ Have fun.
